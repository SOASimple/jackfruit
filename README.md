# jackfruit
Jackfruit is an extensible Unit Testing library designed to be extended to implement domain specific unit tests.
This was initially written to allow unit tests to be described in XML for execution with Software AG's webMethods suite but could be extended to enable tests to be defined for any Java-based execution environment.
